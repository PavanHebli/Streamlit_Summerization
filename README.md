### Text Summerization made easy with streamlit application !!

This repository contains a streamlit application integrated with two LLM providers.
 1. Groq
 2. OpenAI

To be able to use this application one first needs to create account on Groq and OpenAI and generate API keys.
Go to [Groq](https://groq.com/) website, if not created already, create a new account and then generate a key.  
Same goes with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

store the newly generated API keys on your machine to use them on the streamlit application
